Analyze a complex network flow.

Use a txt file with an adjacent list of numbers, the first number is the node id, the second number is the node id for
the adjacent node and the third number is the magnitude. The next two number is another adjacent node and the magnitude 
that is flowing into it, and so on.

Determines the minimum cut and the flow capacity of the network.
